## 🚀 How to Use

If you're learning too and want to explore my code:

1. Clone this repo:

Open the folders and run the .html files in a browser.

Read the comments in the .js files — they explain my thought process.

## 🌟 Reflections
“Learning to write programs stretches your mind and helps you think better.”
— Bill Gates

JavaScript has challenged me to think logically and creatively. I’m excited to keep going, build cool things, and become a better developer with every line of code I write.

## 🛠️ Tools I Use
VS Code – for editing

Live Server – for running HTML files

Chrome DevTools – for debugging

MDN Web Docs – my go-to reference
